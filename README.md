# Plethora Py

## Branches

Currently, the *master* branch contains the documents for the progress report (`documents/Progress Report.docx`), software implementation and testing document (`documents/IT.docx`), and software requirements and design document (`documents/RD.docx`).

Code for the UI and API exist in the *develop* branch. This contains a simple test game to illustrate the UI, game handoff and communication, and the API.

Code for each member exists in his respective "*feature/*" branch:

- Dylan McClure (dmm18dk): **chess** on *feature/chess*
- Julian Sweatt (js15f): **connect4** on *feature/connect4*
- Caleb Smith (cas16w): **tic-tac-toe** on *feature/tictactoe*
- Lucas Zaval√≠a (lrz17): **tetris** on *feature/tetris*
- Michael Heron (mph12e): **snake** on *MultiSnake*

## Developers

See *develop* branch for current UI/API and the most up-to-date code. In the future, we will rebase or merge or create a pull request from each game into *develop* and eventually merge with master via pull request in order to integrate each game with the UI and API.
